            <td>CORALINE - 5/5 - With this book, you simply cannot go wrong! If you like a scary, thrilling book that isn't flat out adult horror, this is the one! The story's message will definitely leave you thinking.</td>
            <td>DORK DIARIES : TALES FROM A NOT-SO-FABULOUS LIFE - 5/5 I read this series when I was in middle school and I absolutely loved it. If you're into Diary of a Wimpy Kid, and other diary-style, graphic novels, then I'm sure you will like this teen drama series!</td>
            <td>DOUBLE IDENTITY - 5/5 - For the psychological fans, this is for you! I always wondered if human cloning was possible. This book will show you just what cloning would be like. It's great for all ages too!</td>
            <td>JUNIE B. JONES AND THE STUPID SMELLY BUS - 5/5 - If you're looking for a children's book, this is a great start. My sister and I both read this series when we were in elementary school. Junie B Jones is quite a character and does a great job of showing realistic kid behavior.</td>

	  	<div class="book">
			<h2>Title: Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</h2>
			<button class="toggle-summary">Show Summary</button>
			<p class="summary">This is a summary of the first book from the Harry Potter saga. I read the book and watched the movie and both were amazing! However, I am a book worm so I absolutely fell in love with the book. It's about a boy living with his aunt and uncle, but soon he gets recruited for wizard school in Hogwarts when he comes of age. This is a very thick book, so if you choose to read it keep in mind that you may be reading it for a while. It took me 1 week to finish it, but I definitely recommend!'</p>
